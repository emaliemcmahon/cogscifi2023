## Course description  

What does it mean to be intelligent? Does our experience with language change how we think about the world? How do we develop the ability to interact socially with others? These are some of the questions that this course will explore by engaging both with relevant science fiction and academic research on select topics in Cognitive Science. The course is designed to provide students with a broad introduction to many areas of active research in Cognitive Science. Through this, students will be exposed to many different domains and methods within Cognitive Science including philosophy, computational modeling, comparative cognition, developmental psychology, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and human behavior. Additionally, students experience science fiction across several different mediums: short stories, podcasts, movies, television, and a novel. 


## Course goals

###  By the end of this course, you will be…

1. aware of common topics and methods in Cognitive Science (CogSci).
2. aware of the real limitations, concerns, and ethical considerations in the CogSci.
3. able to critically evaluate academic articles in CogSci and weigh different theoretical perspectives. 
4. critically engage with science fiction and other popular media presentations of CogSci.
5. Potential bonus goal: You will develop or foster a life-long enthusiasm for science fiction :) 

###  What our goal is not
The course is partially intended to foster an enjoyment of science fiction across many different mediums. Our goal will not be to dismiss the value of science fiction because it is not scientifically accurate. It is fiction afterall, and its purpose is not to teach us about science. 

## Class meeting structure
On alternating days, we will engage with either science fiction or CogSci articles. 

###  Science-fiction days
The first half of the class meeting will be a discussion focused on the CogSci themes in the sci-fi material. I will close out the class by giving a short lecture that summarizes some of the work being done in the particular area of cognitive science. 

###  Academic article days
These classes will be entirely discussion based. Students will be responsible for summarizing the main points of the assigned readings in discussion. We will also compare what is currently known about the particular topic and relate it to the science fiction reading from the previous day. 

## Grading 

Quizzes - 50%

Participation/Attendance - 50% 

###  Quizzes
This course will require completing the assigned readings before class. To check that you have prepared for the class, there will be very short comprehension quizzes. If you have engaged with the material, the quizzes should be very straightforward and easy.  

###  Participation/Attendance
You will be expected to have come to class having read the academic articles or having read/view/listened to the science fiction. Prior to class, you should consider the themes of the science fiction or academic articles and how they relate to other things that we have discussed in the course. 

###  How to succeed
Earning a “Satisfactory” in this course will require that you have an average of 70% across all the quizzes and attend and participate in at least 70% of class meetings. 

## Missed Class/Quizz Policy

If you are sick or unable to attend class/complete quizzes for any reason, you can miss up to 4 classes (attend 10 total) and 3 quizzes (take and pass 9 total) without contacting me. If you anticipate more protracted/frequent absences or missing work, please contact me and we can discuss alternate arrangements which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  

## Readings

All academic articles and short stories will be linked or posted directly on the course website. 

There is are two novellas assigned for the course that can be purchased or checked out from a library. I recommend starting from the Enoch Pratt Free Public Library that has some physical, ebook, and audiobook copies. 

You will need to stream the movies/TV shows yourself. If there is an interest, I can also host a streaming session in the evening in Krieger. 

## Diversity in readings

An unfortunate reality of both CogSci and sci-fi is that both fields have little diversity. In the selection of readings for this course, I have tried to highlight work people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and women. We will be particularly focusing on contemporary work in CogSci and sci-fi.
