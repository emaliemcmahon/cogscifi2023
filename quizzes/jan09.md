# Language & Thought: *Arrival*

1. Explain why it is that Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) experiences "memories" of her daughter throughout the film. 

2. Why does Louise's husband leave her? What do you think of this decision?

3. Relating this back to the conversation on Free Will, how do you think that knowing how any given moment would unfold would make you think/act?

4. Can you provide examples from your own experience in which you feel like language influences your thoughts? 

5. In light of your answer above, what do you think about the assertation that language has the capacity to dramatically restructure thought? 

6. In the short story that the movie is based on "Stories of Your Life" by Ted Chiang, the aliens only ever stated that their reason for visiting Earth was "to observe" but did not ask Louise more questions about human/earth than they did in the movie. What do you think of the filmmakers decision to change the aliens reason for visiting into a transaction with humanity? 

7. Related to the above, in the short story, Louise never tells other people that she has the capacity to "see the future," but based on the reason for her divorce and her interaction with General Shang in the movie, I presume that it is common knowledge. Do you have the same presumption? Regardless, do you think it would be better for Louis to tell or not tell people?

8. Do you have any questions that you would like to discuss in class?
