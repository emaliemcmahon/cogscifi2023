- [ ] supplementary motor area
- [ ] primary motor cortices
- [ ] frontopolar cortex
- [ ] precuneus
- [ ] posterior cingulate cortex

- [ ] supplementary motor area
- [ ] primary motor cortices
- [ ] frontopolar cortex
- [ ] precuneus
- [ ] posterior cingulate cortex

4. In Smith (2011), philosophers are quoted critiquing the conclusions of Song et al (2008). What is the primary basis for this critique?
- [ ] Song et al (2008)'s conclusion assumes that the "mind" and "brain" are separate
- [ ] Song et al (2008) have not replicated their findings
- [ ] If Song et al (2008)'s conclusions were correct, there would be a breakdown of law and order
- [ ] Song et al (2008) did not use sophisticated enough techniques to answer the question

5. Smith (2011) discusses research from Kathleen Vohs on how people behave when they have more deterministic views. In that work, participants were found to be more likely to ...
